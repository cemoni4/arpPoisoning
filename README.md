# arpPoisoning
This Python script utilizes the scapy library to perform ARP spoofing attacks on a target network. The script continuously sends spoofed ARP packets between two target hosts to intercept network traffic. It also includes a method for cleaning the ARP table of the target hosts when the attack is stopped.
